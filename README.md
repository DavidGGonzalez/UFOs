Module 11: UFO Sightings with JavaScript

## Overview

## Resources
* Data Source: data.js

## Summary
### Drawbacks/Suggestions
* Criteria or filter by data is case sensitive, I would add a way to allow users to search by either case instead
* It is difficult to set a filter if we don't know the data, i.e.: shape of the UFOs, I would provide a list of each search criteria via a dropdown lists, this would facilitate filter entries.
